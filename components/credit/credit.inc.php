            <p class="definitiontext">Credit scores are numerical values that are used by lenders and financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses. They are based on various factors, such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit used, and new credit. </p>

            <div class="content">
                   <p class="cont">The FICO credit score is the most popular and widely used credit scoring model. Created in 1989 by the Fair Issac Corporation (which rebranded to FICO in 2009), this credit score follows a 300-850 scale where a higher score is better. According to FICO's website, their score is used by 90% of top lenders. <br><br>
                    our FICO score is based on the content of your credit report. Three major credit bureaus — Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax — track your credit activity for your credit score. You could have a different FICO score based on which credit bureau is supplying your credit report.<br></p>

            <div class="content2">

                <p class="cont">VantageScore is a newer credit-scoring model created by the three major credit bureaus as an alternative to FICO. Like FICO, VantageScore has been updated several times. While VantageScore initially had a 501-900 scale, VantageScore 3.0 changed the grading scale to match FICO's, using a 300-850 scale. <br><br>
                Your VantageScore can be based on any of your three credit reports. It uses a slightly different weighting for factors than your FICO score.<br></p>
