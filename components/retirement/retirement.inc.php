                <p class="cont">Good news! People on average are living longer and are able to remain healthy and active well into their sunset years.<br><br>
But many Americans havenâ€™t saved or invested enough money to retire in their 60s with the confidence that their funds will last. Both the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have estimated that approximately 50% of today's retirees have cut back on their spending, or will be forced to do so, due to dwindling resources.<br><br>
Far too many retirees end up relying on Social Security to cover the majority of their living expenses only to find out the hard way that it isn't nearly enough. Social Security retirement income is only designed to replace about 40% of the average worker's salary, but more than one in five married couples and 45% of single retirees depend on Social Security for more than 90% of their incomes in retirement.<br><br>
The bottom line is that, while many get by without ever making and executing a retirement plan, those who most enjoy their retirement do so in part due to having a retirement plan. Retirement planning is what can help you to be financially comfortable after you leave your job. </p>
